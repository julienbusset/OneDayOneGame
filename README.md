# OneDayOneGame
Javascript framework for js game development

## A few questions to start the project
- Shall I use something like node.js to build a readable project which will be transformed into a distributable version?
- Shall I manage inner dependencies? How to make sure a DOM object has been initiated before using it? Using flags?
- Shall I define CSS classes in load.js?
